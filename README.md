# kafka-technical-crypto-indicators
I was inspired by a talk by Ludvig Sandman and Bruce Zulu at Kafka Summit London 2019,  "Using Kafka Streams to Analyze Live Trading Activity for Crypto Exchanges", to create this project where I'm utilizing Kafka to set up a producer/consumer architecture for technical indicators in crypto. So far there's just one technical indicator utilized which is the Bollinger Bands, hwoever, more will be added in the future.
